Diagnosing heart failure often requires the integration of complex clinical and pathological data. This complexity has driven significant interest among researchers and healthcare professionals in developing accurate and efficient heart failure prediction methods. In this study, we propose an advanced heart failure prediction system designed to assist medical professionals in predicting heart failure status using patient clinical data. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we identify and prioritize 13 critical clinical features, including age, sex, anemia, creatinine phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection fraction, high blood pressure, platelets, serum creatinine, serum sodium, smoking, time, and Death Event. Next, we employ Machine Learning algorithms to classify heart failure based on these features, achieving a prediction accuracy of approximately 80%. Finally, we design a user-centric heart failure prediction system (HFPS) with features such as an input data interface, ROC curve visualization, and detailed performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, execution time, and prediction outcomes. The proposed HFPS demonstrates effectiveness in heart failure classification and offers a novel, feature-driven machinelearning framework for clinical decision support. 

The human heart is one of the most vital and intricate organs in the body, making its health and care essential for overall wellbeing. A significant proportion of diseases are associated with the heart, and the ability to predict such conditions plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. Unfortunately, many patients succumb to heart-related illnesses because their conditions are detected at advanced stages, often due to the lack of accurate diagnostic tools. This highlights the pressing need for more efficient and reliable algorithms to predict heartrelated diseases early. Early prediction provides individuals with an opportunity to seek timely medical intervention, thereby increasing their chances of survival and improving quality of life. The goal of this project is to develop an advanced heart failure prediction system capable of identifying individuals who are at a higher risk of heart failure, empowering them to take proactive steps toward early treatment. For this purpose, the focus is on leveraging the power of Machine Learning (ML), an innovative and highly efficient technology that has transformed the way predictions and diagnoses are performed in healthcare. Machine Learning, as a specialized branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables systems to emulate human cognitive abilities by training algorithms on historical data to make accurate predictions. This "Machine Intelligence" is particularly valuable in clinical settings where vast amounts of data must be processed and analyzed to uncover meaningful insights.
